To compile Seed programs, you need the jar files from the lib directory in this folder in your classpath

You also need the libs in your classpath to run.  Remember to put your project in the classpath, or create a jar
with project and place it on the lib directory.

Since this is a prototype, always test your project first using a single computer and shared memory before
testing it on a network.
